DynObj - 0.50
-------------
The library provides supports for run-time loaded plugin classes in C++.

The compiler used to build the plugin can be different than the compiler
used for the main application. 

It provides object instantiation and run-time casts that work across compiler 
and DLL/SO boundaries.

The library is written in portable C++ to 99%. The remaining 1% is a 
minimalistic platform layer, to handle dynamic libraries, threading and
synchronization for a particular platform. 

The releationship between an application and a plugin is a loose one, 
defined by one or several interface classes (ordinary C++ headers). 

The end result is plugin class libraries that are binary reusable between  
different applications and compilers on the platform they're built for.
If the plugin in itself is portable, it can be recompiled used on another
platform.


Building:
---------
A cross-platform GNU makefile is provided in the src/DynObj folder (also 
works for mingw/gcc on Windows). 

For Windows, a Visual C++ solution file is in the src/DynObj/msdev folder. 

Currently builds on 32-bit Windows and Linux.


Documentation:
--------------
doc/DynObj-intro.html    An article that describes the background of the 
                         problem and how DynObj implements a solution.
doc/doxygen/index.html   Class documentation generated by Doxygen. The 
                         "Modules" page provides the best starting point.
