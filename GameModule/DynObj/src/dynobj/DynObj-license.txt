Part B: Advised use/practise 
===============================================================================

* When creating binary libraries using the DynObj library, aim at maintaining
binary compatibility with other libraries on the same platform. 

In more detail, this means:

  * Use the same exported symbol names for library interface functionality:
  
      CreateDynObj, InitDynLib, ExitDynLib, DestroyDynObj.
    
    Then others can interface safely with the library
    
  * For data-structures, do not modify or move existing members inside a
    data structure. In particular, this applies to:
    
      DynObjType, DynObjLibImpl
      
  * Do not modify interfaces included in the core distribution. In particular
    this applies to:
    
     DynObj.h, DoBaseI.h, DynStr.h
      
    Modifying these interfaces would lead to run-time errors when linked in 
    a different run-time setting.

* If used in a software package, the project/developers (www.sourceforge.net/
projects/dynobj) would appreciate knowing about it.
